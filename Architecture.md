PowerShell-Based System Architecture for Package Management

### PowerShell-Based System Architecture for Package Management

#### 1. **Package Updater Service**

- **Responsibilities**:
    - Monitors specified artifact feeds (e.g., Azure DevOps, NuGet) for new package versions.
    - Compares remote package versions with locally installed versions.
    - Implements configurable intervals for version checks.
    - Supports multiple authentication methods for artifact feeds.
    - Logs version check results and update attempts for auditing and troubleshooting.

#### 2. **Worker Components**

- **Responsibilities**:
    - Executes package installation and upgrade operations.
    - Handles package dependency resolution to ensure smooth updates.
    - Implements rollback capabilities for failed installations to maintain system stability.
    - Provides status reporting and error handling mechanisms.
    - Runs as background jobs to prevent blocking the system during operations.

#### 3. **Core Requirements**

- Compatible with PowerShell 5.1+.
- Secure credential management for accessing artifact feeds.
- Configurable update policies and schedules to meet organizational needs.
- Event logging and notification system for monitoring activities.
- Health monitoring and reporting to ensure system reliability.

#### 4. **Integration Points**

- **Artifact Feed API Integration**: Supports APIs like Azure DevOps and NuGet for fetching packages.
- **Key Vault**: Contains credentials, like PAT token. 

#### 5. **Deployment Considerations**

- Minimal system impact during updates to ensure uninterrupted operations.
- Disaster recovery procedures to handle failures effectively.
