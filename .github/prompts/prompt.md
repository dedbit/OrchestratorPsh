Create a PowerShell-based system architecture with the following requirements:

Core Components:
1. Package Updater Service
- Monitor specified artifacts feed for package updates
- Monitors for a specific nuget package. If a new version is available it gets downloaded. 
- Compare local and remote package versions
- Trigger installation workflow for newer versions
- Maintain update history and logs
- Implement error handling and rollback capabilities

2. Worker Service
- Execute distributed processing tasks
- Handle job queue management
- Provide status reporting and monitoring
- Implement fault tolerance and recovery

System Requirements:
- Windows PowerShell 5.0 or higher
- Integration with artifact repository (Azure DevOps, NuGet, etc.)
- Secure credential management
- Update intervals are handled by Windows task scheduler that executes script. 
- Health monitoring and alerting
- Logging and telemetry

Package Management:
- Version comparison logic
- Package validation before installation
- Dependency resolution
- Installation verification
- Keeps a backup of the 5 most recent packages

Integration Points:
- Artifact repository API
- Configuration management
- Authentication service

Performance Considerations:
- Concurrent package processing
- Network timeout handling
- Resource utilization limits
- Update scheduling windows
- Retry policies

Security Requirements:
- Secure communication with artifact feeds
- Package signature verification
- Least privilege execution
- Audit logging
- Access control implementation
- Personal Access Token based authentication
