Run the currently open PowerShell script by its filename (e.g., ./path/to/test-module.ps1), not using pwsh or powershell. Whenever you encounter errors, analyze the error messages, update the script to fix each error, and rerun the script. Repeat this process and keep fixing errors until the script executes without any errors. Do not ask for confirmation or clarificationâ€”just fix and proceed automatically.
